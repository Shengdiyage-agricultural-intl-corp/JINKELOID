Welcome to VERRICKT's KELALIST
=================

Hey,there . I'm Verrickt.
I love music, Vocaloid and especially ,Jinkela.

The reason I make this this repository is that I want to
make all songs I love a Jinkela version.


As shown by the directory name, each directory is 
contains all the material I used to bring the Jinkela version
to life.



There're several kind of material available :

> UTAU Sequence Texts files(.ust) which require a jklex voice bank that you can get [here](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_711e86460101ci5f.html)

> FL Studio song files(.flp)

> Musicial Instrumental Digital Interface files(.midi)

> Adobe Audition Session files(.sesx) need [Waves](http://www.waves.com/) and [Izotope Ozone](https://www.izotope.com) and extra attention.

> Jinkela version of the song


Though I'd like to share EVERYTHING with you ,material that available to you may vary from songs.

I love opensource and if the material above are useful to you, please let me know.

I will be happy about that.

For copyright propose I removed the originating version of the song from sesx
files. You'll have to use the link your own version in AU.
